	<h1> What is HIIT? </h1>
	<p> Spending hours on a treadmill to burn calories is not usually the most efficient way to do cardio. Even if its not about effiency, it can be tiring, repeatitive, and drag on and on for only a few hundred calories. Thats why HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) is the secret. HIIT is a form of interval training, a cardiovascular exercise strategy alternating short periods of intense anaerobic exercise with less intense recovery periods, until too exhausted to continue.... its okay I did not understand much of that either. This is why I've condensed it in simple terms. The problem with hours on cardio machines is that as soon as you step off - you stop burning calories. With HIIT </p>

        <li> You can finish your cardio in less than 15 minutes</li>
        <li> Burn a thousand calories by putting your body into recovery mode, which will burn calories even when you are sitting on your couch watching TV, hours after the gym</li>
        <li> Have fun! </li>

    <h2> An example HIIT excercise on the treadmill with 30 second work time and 1 min 30 second rest </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Spend 3 minutes walking at a comfortable spead as a warm up </li>
        <li> At 3:00 min, step on the sides of the treadmill for a 1 minute 30 sec rest and increase the speed to a full sprint. I usually increase the speed to 9.0 MPH with 0.0 Incline but for beginners, I would recommend a 6.0 MPH with 0.0 Incline</li>
        <li> At 4:30, break the treadmill running as fast as you can for 30 seconds</li>
        <li> After 30 seconds, rest for 1 min 30 seconds by standing on the edges of the treadmil</li>
        <li> Repeat 3-4 sprints for beginners, 5-8 for intermediate/advanced</li>
        <li> And you're done...all under 15 minutes./li>
        <li> Repeat three times a week for the most optimum results</li>
